# API Proxy for Frontend Developers

It is terrible to debug your frontend codes within the java project, as you have to restart whole Java program to see effects.
Now this proxy written in PHP is a shortcut for those prefer Apache/Nginx with PHP/Curl.
You can now start the Java program and leave it running, and focus on your frontend coding and debugging now.
No more restart work!
